# Food-and-Safety-Restaurant-Infection

##Introduction
This document provides a brief description of restaurant inspection data by the DC Department 
of Health, the key outcome variables, and results of initial predictive analysis for those key
outcome variables.

Food establishments that sell or serve food to the public must apply for a health permit and be
inspected for compliance with the DC Department of Health. These establishments include
restaurants, school cafeterias, bakeries, mobile food vendors, and markets. Most of the
permitted food service establishments in Washington, DC receive two routine unannounced food
safety inspections per year. DOH follows the federal food code and only closes an establishment
for critical violations that cannot be corrected while an inspector is onsite (for several hours) and
poses immediate harm to residents and visitors to the District. The purpose of a food safety
inspection is to ensure the food is being handled properly from preparation through serving.
This project will help in identifying common factors of establishments that can guide future
training efforts for business owners and staff and further help the department allocate staff
resources in a more efficient and effective manner.

The primary goals for the project are
  1. Analyze the relationship between establishment features and the kind of violations found
     during inspections
  2. Develop a predictive model to predict with a high degree of accuracy the type of violations
     for each establishment
  3. Develop an application that tracks upcoming inspections, displays information on expiring
     licenses, and aids in the prioritization of inspections based on predicted violations
     
This repository currently only captures the data cleaning, analysis of relationship between key 
variables, and a predictive model for violations.
